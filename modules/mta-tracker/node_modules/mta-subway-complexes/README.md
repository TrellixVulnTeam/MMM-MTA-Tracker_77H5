# MTA Complexes

The MTA classifies subway stations as complexes, both in [Stations.csv](http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/Stations.csv) as well as [StationComplexes.csv](http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/StationComplexes.csv).

This package combines those two data sources to create one JSON output of complex data.
